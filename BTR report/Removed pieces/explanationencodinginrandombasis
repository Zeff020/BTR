With this result we can replace the encoding and subsequent Pauli maps from equation (\ref{equation:movevthrough}) by encoding into one of the four bases at random. Note that we have so far only shown that this is a valid operation whenever we have some input state $g$. The only reason for why we had this input state was to show the color of classical data that enters the encoding map. In this case, however, we do not care about the color of classical data that enters the encoding map since Alice does no processing in the classical domain. We can therefore omit the triangles in equation (\ref{equation:fourcolourspiders}) altogether and assume that the color of the classical data is always in the correct basis. In section \ref{section:QAaSBEequivalences}, where we do mix classical processing and colored spiders, we will introduce a map that deals with this as needed.
