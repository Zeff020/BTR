\footnote{The careful reader may notice that replacing the brown encoding spider in equation (\ref{equation:RedSpiderRandomPauli}) by a red encoding spider and two subsequent Pauli's brings with it some further complications. This is because the red encoding spider accepts classical data only in the red basis, whereas the brown spider could accept all the colors of classical data. In this section, this will not form a problem. Since we do not do any classical processing on the data, we could just assume the classical data is in the appropriate basis. In section \ref{section:QAaSBEequivalences}, where we will mix classical processing with colored spiders, we define a map that can solve this issue accordingly.}

 \footnote{The main differences between equations (\ref{equation:composingtwopaulis}) and (\ref{equation:QKRQAaSBD3}) are that in the latter we send some information to Eve and use the eight state encryption map. Sending some information to Eve will play an important role later. The fact that we do not use the eight state encryption map in equation (\ref{equation:composingtwopaulis}) is actually not that big of a difference. In fact, we could have added it in there already, it was just not necessary. Adding it in helps us translate between the four bases of eight state encoding and the z basis such that we can do classical processing in the basis for which we have defined the relevant tools, such as the xor map. Since back in equation (\ref{equation:composingtwopaulis}) we did not do such classical processing introducing this map was unnecessary.}
